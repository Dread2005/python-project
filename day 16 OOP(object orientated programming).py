# classes and objects #

    ### objects ###
    # attributes(what it has(it's a variable that's associated with a modeled object ) #
    # methods(what it does(functions that a modeled object can do) #

    ### classes ###
    # we can have multiple versions of the same objects #
    # the class is the blueprint of the object and is what lets us create multiple of the same object #

    # what class and object would look like in python 
    # car{object} = CarBlueprint(){class} # # to create an object first give it a name, then use an = to assign it to the class, always have  () in your class #

    ### attributes ###
    # object.attribute(car[object].speed[attribute])
    # car.speed = 100

   ### method ### 
    # a method is an function(def func()) that is tied to an object
    # what it looks like: car.stop()# #car, is the object and Stop() is the method being called
