### SLICING ###
#piano_keys [a, b, c, d, e , f, g]
#slicing piano_keys[2:5]
# 2 = c and 5 = f
#piano_keys [2:5] are piano_keys c, d, e
# this sign : is what's used to slice the list
#[2:] gives the whole list from 2

#piano_keys[2:5:2]
#piano_keys c, e
#the third number is what it counts in, in this eg its slicing from 2 to 5 in 2s

# [::-1] reverses the whole list
